                    I tutored data science students on introductory Linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability
and Statistics.<br> The experience was fun and educative with students coming from vary
background and trying to make mathematics <br>concepts not just theoretical but tangible
so as students will appreciate what I call the soul of mathematics.<br><br>

                    As a MasterCard scholar, we embarked on an outreach to Biriwa Junior High School in
                    Biriwa, Cape Coast.<br> The objective of the outreach was to encourage students to pursue
                    careers in science and also to dissipate <br> the notion about mathematics been extremely
                    difficult. The interest for mathematics was ignited through playing mathematical<br> games
                    with the students. I had fun educating and interacting with the students and challenged
                    them to become the next Einstein.<br><br>
